        <h2>my village</h2>
        <p style="color:brown">The name of my village is lalganj.<br> 


            It is situated in the district of vaishali, about 50 km away from district.<br>
            
             There are about 1000 people live in my village. All the villagers are very cordial and supportive. Most of the villagers are farmers. They grow paddy, jute and vegetables.</p>
<h3 style="color:blue"></h3>
<p style="color:brown">There is a primary school, a health care center and a post office in my village. <br>
    There is a large playground where we play in the afternoon. A pucca road runs through the middle of our village. We get all the necessary things from the village market. People living here are poor but they are very kind and honest. I love my village very much.
